title: Monterrey as a Startup Hub
---

### I wrote this a while back, hope it makes a great first post. 

I've been reading PG's Essay "How to Make Pittsburgh a Startup Hub". Can't help but notice that Monterrey,Mexico (my hometown) has many similarities as a city with Pittsburgh.
Interesting read that gives me some ideas about how can Mty become a startup hub like SV.

1. Monterrey is mostly an industrial city known for its big companies like Cemex, Femsa, Alfa etc. PG says Pittsburgh was the Silicon Valley of its time, with titans like Westinghouse, A. Carnegie, and A.W. Mellon all residing there.

2. Money and jobs all left Pittsburgh after the decline of steel which included globalization and cheaper places to manufacture it. Monterrey thrives in sectors such as steel, cement, auto parts, and brewing.

3. Guadalajara is reinventing itself to a tech hub with companies like Wizeline leading the way. One factor is the proximity it has with SF and it's 3 and a half hour flight.

4. As PG says, education is key and Pittsburgh has top quality universities like CMU. Monterrey has ITESM and UDEM as their top universities and it's home to thousands of talent. 
   The problem is, talented students (for example CS Majors who could act as CTO's in startups) always aim to leave Monterrey or enter high paying businesses. 

5. Money flows in Monterrey which is home to one of the richest cities in Latin America. There's also many venture capital firms like Dalus Capital, Alta Ventures, and Ignia.
